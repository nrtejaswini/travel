                                                                                   # Travel and Tourism Management System
The Travel and Tourism Management System is a comprehensive application designed to efficiently manage the details of customers, hotel bookings, cancellations, and tourist destinations. This system serves as an all-encompassing platform to handle user information, hotel data, tour packages, and more. It has been developed primarily for administrative purposes, ensuring that only authorized administrators have access to the backend database.

## Purpose
The primary objective of this project is to create an application that streamlines and automates the management of tourists, bookings, and various destinations. By digitizing these processes, the system aims to significantly reduce manual work and enhance efficiency in handling travel-related activities.

## Features
Customer Management: Manage customer details, preferences, and booking history.
Hotel Booking: Facilitate hotel reservations, cancellations, and room preferences.
Tourism Places: Store information about tourist destinations, attractions, and packages.
Administrator Access: Ensure secure access to the backend database exclusively for administrators.
## Usage
The system offers a user-friendly interface for administrators to perform various tasks, including:

Adding, modifying, or deleting customer information.
Handling hotel bookings, cancellations, and room allocations.
Managing tourism places, packages, and associated details.

## Installation
To deploy this system:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Set up the necessary database configurations as specified in the documentation.
Run the application and ensure all dependencies are installed correctly.

## Security
As the backend database access is limited to administrators, security measures have been implemented to safeguard sensitive information. Access controls and authentication mechanisms have been put in place to prevent unauthorized access.
